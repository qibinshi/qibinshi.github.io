# About Me

I am currrently a postdoc in Dr. [Marine Denolle](https://denolle-lab.github.io/)'s group at University of Washington.

## Research interests

### Earthquake physics
Earthquake coseismic rupture process inversions. 
Source complexities of moderate-size earthquakes in the mantle. 
Seismic cycles of fast and slow slip in the brittle-viscous subduction system. 
Three-dimensional wave field from complex rupture processes.

### Offshore seismic hazard
Using machine learning methods to denoise earthquake waveforms collected from the ocean bottom. 
Integrating distributed acoustic sensing and traditional seismic network.
Looking for slow earthquakes in the Pacific-northwest subduction zone.

### Environmental seismology
Using ambient noises to probe near-surface velocity structure.
Observing characteristic soil vibrations with distributed acoustic sensing.
