## About

I am a geophysicist working on earthquake physics, agroseismology,
distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), and data-driven seismology.
My research focuses on environmental processes, fault mechanics,
and large-N seismic arrays.

## Research Interests

- Agroseismology & soil hydrodynamics  
- Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)  
- Environmental & near-surface seismology  
- Machine learning for seismology  
- Earthquake rupture physics  

## Education

- **Ph.D. Geophysics**, Nanyang Technological University (2021)  
- **B.Sc. Geology**, Nanjing University (2016)

## Professional Experience

- **Pan Postdoctoral Fellow**, Rice University (2025–present)  
- **Postdoctoral Scholar**, University of Washington (2022–2024)
